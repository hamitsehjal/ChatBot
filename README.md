# ChatBot
Chat Bot using JAVA

The Chatbot project highlights my expertise in Java web development and demonstrates my understanding of object-oriented design and best practices. Built using Java and web-based technologies, the chatbot incorporates natural language processing algorithms to respond to user queries. The backend of the chatbot utilizes Java/JEE with Spring, while the interactive and responsive user interface is developed with JavaFX. This project showcases my ability to create seamless and intuitive conversations with users across different devices.
